## Hi there 👋

# 🚀 Hi, I’m Tochi Michael

I’m a **Frontend / Software Developer** focused on building **modern, high-performance web applications** with clean architecture and strong user experience.

I don’t just write code — I **build products**, solve real problems, and continuously push my skills forward. I’m currently building **EventHub**, an event discovery platform, while sharpening my React and software engineering fundamentals in public.

I’m intentional about growth, consistency, and becoming a world-class engineer.
